# Frontend

This project runs using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
It is recommended to run using the `docker-compose.yml` present in the parent directory.
If you prefer running the frontend directly, run `npm install` and `npm start`.

Tools for development:
- prettier, run `npm run prettier` to format the code;
- eslint, run `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix` to view and attempt to fix linting issues.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to build an optimized production bundle with vite.
