## Milestone Overview

In this milestone, you need to implement a static version of your project system (i.e., a static dashboard).

- You don't need to implement all views and features. But you need to explain how the rest of the features will be integrated in the future during the office hour.
- You don't need to implement interactions.
- The data used for rendering the front end should be queried from the data server implemented in Milestone-II.

## Frontend

- Are the visual elements appropriate?
- Is the dashboard designed to support communicating a workflow?
- How are the visual elements sorted?
- Where will future interaction be implemented?
- Are there explainability components integrated or planned?
- Are different views in the dashboard sharing consistent encodings?

## Backend

- Is the backend able to provide appropriate information to the frontend?
- Is the backend reasonably efficient in the communication or is the lag caught in the frontend?
- Are the endpoints working?

## Aesthetics

- Are colors used in a way that is helpful to the readability and storyline?
- Are the different parts of the interface clear? (aka. is the space correctly used, no overlap, whitespace)
- Does the design follow the perception design principles discussed in the lecture? (i.e., is it using coherent visual designs, are the visual designs according to the best practices)
- Does the dashboard provide a narrative that is easy to follow?
- Does the storytelling answer the question the dashboard wants to answer?
