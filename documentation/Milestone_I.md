## Project Focus

- Clear Research Question: How do Policies affect happiness within a country
- Is there a computer/user interaction: Exploring the map, Different criteria for correlation with happiness, writing policies, getting feedback regarding optimal policy selection.

## User and Tasks

- Are the stakeholders/users specified: Policymakers are our stakeholders/users
- What are the user's needs from the interactive dashboard: Getting feedback on optimal budget allocation in terms of policy selection
- Do the tasks fit the stakeholders/users and their data: The tasks fit the stakeholders very well, because their ultimate aim is to find good policies within their

## Data and Model

- Was the data set investigated? (type of data, etc): yes, numerical data - need to merge multiple datasets to augment the original dataset
- Does the model fit the question/data: We don't have a model yet

## Interface and Interaction Design Ideas

- Is the overall storyline and workflow coherent: -
- Are the interface and interaction design ideas convincing: -

parallel chart
picking countries
map of the world
democracy index
visualizing how policies will change over time
gamified vs real world values

how do we distinguish the dollar value of the policies

- input the name of the policy so it can be shown on the chart
- only compare policies with similar costs?
- have a budget and pick the best combination? like knapsack
- find most beneficial and best combination

correlations between value and happiness:

- logistic probably?
